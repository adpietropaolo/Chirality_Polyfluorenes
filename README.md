# Chirality_Polyfluorenes
The directory PF_coordinates contains two subdirectories:
1- PF_DFT includes the coordinates of polyfluorenes derived through DFT optimizations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory.
2- PF_SMD includes the coordinates of polyfluorenes derived through Steered Molecular Dynamics simulations at 300 K 
within GROMACS 2016.3 package and using the Charmm General force field force field combined with the the charges and the dihedral potential reported in 
"J. Phys. Chem. B 2006, 110, 5253âˆ’5261",
